 Description: Use a dataset containing customer information and usage
data to train a model that can predict the likelihood of customer churn.
 Key Steps:
o Data cleaning and preprocessing
o Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features
o Feature engineering
o Model selection and training (e.g., logistic regression, random forests)
o Model evaluation and fine-tuning
o Implementing the model in a real-world system
